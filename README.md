Doing this design was relatively easy and fast.

I guess the only remarkable thing I did was centering the frame XD. I used nested layout technique and flexbox aswell.

That's about it, I still do not know what is "good enough" for responsive layout I just used
min-width: 375px;
max-width : 144px;
in the body element so the design doesnt get chaotics. I hope you could give me your opinions about this project + advice about responsive designing.
Thanks :D
